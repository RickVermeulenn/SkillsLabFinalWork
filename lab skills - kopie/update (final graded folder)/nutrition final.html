<h4>Cutting diets</h4>

<p class="font9">
  Cutting is a term used for the act of losing weight and body fat, while saving muscle mass. There are many theories which are said to be “the most effective methods”. Most of these theories are effective indeed, yet some work faster than others. When deconstructing the problem it could be said that there is an excess in body fat, which is actually stored energy from food that you have eaten that is not used by your body. Your body stores this energy in case of an “emergency” when you run without fuel for a period of time so to say. This energy is applied to the notion of “calories”, which is simplified to an unit used for the amount of energy a certain quantity of food has to your body.  When combining these two aspects of energy, it could be said that if you want to burn excess energy (body fat) you need to burn more calories than that you eat! By using an online calorie calculator you can see how many calories you have to take in for your body to operate normally considering your current weight and height. However to burn body fat you have to eat less calories. We advise you to take the calorie intake (ex 2000 kcal) and subtract this by 25% (ex. 2000-500 = 1500). This will result in an average weight decrease of 0.7 kilos a week! No fear, 1 time a week you need a cheat day with which you are allowed to exceed this limit so your body does not get used to the lower calorie intake. This is dangerous since if your body gets used to this lower calorie intake and you will start eating more, it will absorb all this extra energy immediately and you will get a jo-jo effect with your body, making it difficult to lose weight. Doing sports will immensely help with this process, it can be done by doing cardio or bulking. By means of which you can either gain muscle and lose body fat, or lose fat and remain the same. This process could usefully be kept track of through an app such as MyFitnessPal by under armour, which helps you keep track of process and helps you to set goals.

<h4>Bulking diets</h4>

<p class="font9">
 Bulking, is a term used for the act of gaining muscle. Ask any body builder and they will tell you “the training starts in the kitchen”. What they mean with this is that you can get results in the gym by just doing exercises, however your nutrition will amplify these results if it is done correctly. Unlike cutting, for bulking you need to eat high amounts of food. Most say you need to eat around eight times a day ranging from waking up to going to bed. This does not mean you have to eat fast food like Mc Donalds 8 times a day, as you still have to manage the amount of nutrients that are in your foods. To gain muscle nutrients such as protein, creatine, iron and glutamine are essential in your diet. Likewise there are many categories of a specific nutrient such as fast carbs and slow carbs, which differentiate in foods like brown and white rice. These notions have to be taken into account when you eat a specific food whereas for example you need to eat slow carbs when you are resting so your body can absorb these over a period of time, and fast carbs before doing high intensity fiscal activities. Also the amount of nutrients you have to take in depend on your body type, length, weight, digestion, and other attributes to optimize your diet. Therefore you first have to interpret what you want to achieve, possibly find a personal trainer that can help you expand on these interpretations, and lastly create a plan. To give an overall recommendation, if you want to gain muscle and do your exercises correctly, eat enough proteins to help your body restore your body. These can be found in most meat products. Likewise, before going into a competition try and take in some creatine which will help you boost your performance. A full diet can’t be provided as every person’s body and missions differ, however look for someone that is similar to you and read their post, blogs, observe them or ask them for advice.

<h4>Supplements</h4>

<p class="font9">
  Supplements can be simplified to the notion of filtered food. This does not sound appetizing but it can be an important addition to your diet. To expand on the idea of “filtering food” it is meant that supplements are food enhancing products that are made from extracted nutrients. These extracted food products are often sold in powdered forms which you can take in with the help of water, milk, juices or by itself. However try to avoid taking supplements with sodas such as coca cola. Of course it is always better to take nutrients such as protein in through food such as chicken, the problem is this can become very expensive. Imagine buying a pack of chicken and steak every day! Supplementary products such as WEY protein isolate is about 20 euros per kilogram, which is more expensive than a kilogram of steak however lasts for moths longer. Some other nutrients such as creatine are difficult to obtain, and therefore supplements often come in handy. The amount of nutrients you have to take in again depends on your weight, height, and overall goal, and therefore it is important to set some targets, and do some further research on what you have to take, when, how much, and why.
