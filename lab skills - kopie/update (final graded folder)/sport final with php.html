<h4> Cardio and interval </h4>
<p class="font9">
  Cardio and interval training can be beneficial to you and your body in several ways. Both concepts are similar yet a little bit different. To start off, cardio is a notion that describes doing endurance training over a period of time. Take jogging for 30 minutes instead of sprinting for 1 minute for example. When training in this manner and repeating this long term activity it results in your body adapting to this, training itself to be able to make it easier to do this certain activity. That is why you have to increment the amount of time you are doing a certain cardio activity every time your body has adapted to it. Go from 30 minutes to 35 minutes. The benefits it has to you as a person is that it gives a satisfying feeling, resulting in boosting self-confidence. Likewise this activity is very useful when being involved in a cutting diet. 
 </p>
 
<p class="font9">
Interval on the other hand is doing activities in short but powerful bursts. Go jogging, but instead of jogging 30 minutes, sprint for one minute, walk one minute, and repeat this numerous times (until you can’t go anymore). This won’t benefit to your stamina as much as cardio will, however will benefit to your explosive energy, and will result in even more weight loss.

<h4> Muscle intensity training </h4>

<p class="font9">
Muscle exercises also categorise into several notions. One of which is the explosive energy, which  is just lifting or doing something one time very fast on the highest intensity you can endure. This will benefit to your body being able to push out as much energy as possible in one time. Another category is working on your muscle endurance. Which is lifting slightly lower then you normally do, which enables you to do longer sets and will help your muscles to be able to contract for a longer period of time. Lastly bulking demands you to lift a relative high amount of weight, however really stress your muscles. Don’t swerve your body when you lift a weight to add momentum, really lift with your muscle and not with the body. This will burn your muscles, and will make them grow back bigger and stronger. There is no indication to which is the best, it solely depends on your purpose. Do you want to be big? Have explosive energy? Or long term performance rates?

<h4> Muscle relaxation </h4>
<p class="font9">
Muscle relaxation exercises are  highly beneficial for people that want to move elegantly like a ballerina, or people that are emerged in highly stressful situation. Stress does weird things with your body, and therefore is very important to manage. Many theories stat that stress shortens the length of your teeth’s roots, makes you lose hair, and unfortunately affects your joints. Your joints are the most important as there are no real implants for these, and even if there are these will limit your life. It is therefore a serious cause to keep good care of them. This can be done by exercises such as yoga, stretching, saunas, and massages. These are low intensive exercises, however can soften your muscles, joints and pains. Likewise these activities help you move more freely, which can benefit when playing as a winger in football, or being a ballerina, and can thus be affective for a wide range of activities.
